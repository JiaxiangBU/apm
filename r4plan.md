使用R进行项目管理的笔记
================

> Start without writing code but with a clear mind and perhaps a pen and
> paper. This will ensure you keep your objectives at the forefront of
> your mind, without getting lost in the technology.

不谋而合。

> Make your entire workflow as reproducible as possible. knitr can help
> with this in the phase of documentation.

> Data analysis. Here you are trying to explore datasets to discover
> something interesting/answer some questions. The emphasis is on speed
> of manipulating your data to generate interest results. Formality is
> less important in this type of project. Sometimes this analysis
> project may only be part of a larger project (the data may have to be
> created in a lab, for example). How the data analysts interact with
> the rest of the team may be as important for the project’s success as
> how they interact with each other.

> Gantt charts.
> 
> plotrix, a general purpose plotting package, provides basic Gantt
> chart plotting functionality. Enter example(gantt.chart) for details.
> 
> DiagrammeR, a new package for creating network graphs and other
> schematic diagrams in R. This package provides an R interface to
> simple flow-chart file formats such as mermaid and GraphViz.
